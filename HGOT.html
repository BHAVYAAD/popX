    <div id="hey" style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: antiquewhite;">  <I>IT ALL STARTED WITH A BOOK,In 1996, George R.R. Martin published A Game of Thrones, the first novel in his A Song of Ice and Fire series. A novel, in which a Game of Thrones takes place over the course of one year on or near the fictional continent of Westeros. 
        The series follows a lot of twists and mystery,Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. A second focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's northern border. GAME OF THRONES is a HBO original, a very interesting series and is a must watch. </I> </div>
